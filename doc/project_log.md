I went to Johnny's office hours and we discussed possibilities for what I should do for the project. I will write my paper about the Triangular Monotone Increasing Maps. He has done some research on these and gave some insight of what he knows. It turns out that the flow of these maps will have a unique output, but there are different the flow can be designed differently so that it converges faster. A common way to do it is for each map, we have $f_1(x_1) =y_1, f_2(x_1,x_2)=y_2,...,f_n(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)=y_n.$ Then we repeat this process for the next ongoing maps. This will converge, but at a slow rate because the first component is not acted upon by its covariates. The alternative is to reverse the dependencies on the next map. So we have $g_1(y_1,y_2,...,y_n)=z_1,g_2(y_1,y_2,...,y_{n-1})=z_2,...,g_n(y_n)=z_n.$
